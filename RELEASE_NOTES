1.0.0 (11/27/2012)
    - first official release
1.0.1 (1/3/2013)
    - fix an issue with {rpc,publish}_receiver_count of hubs not
      including themselves even though they would handle it
1.0.2 (1/3/2013)
    - packaging issue with 1.0.1
1.0.3 (1/3/2013)
    - backend module fix so we don't demand that gevent be installed
1.0.4 (1/3/2013)
    - broadcast RPC bugfixes, particularly when the sending hub itself
      is one of the handlers

1.1.0 (1/31/2013)
    - added a .peers() method to Hub, which returns the list of
      connected peers' (host, port) pairs
1.1.1 (4/4/2013)
    - fix the peers() function, it was very broken
    - backport of the 2.0 futures implementation but with shims to clean
        up backwards-incompatibilities
        - improvements:
            - new Future class is the base for RPC and Dependents, and
                is also useful on its own for building out APIs that can
                cooperatively wait together with RPCs and Dependents.
            - wait_any can now collectively wait on a list of *any*
                futures (including RPCs, Dependents), even if they came
                from different Hubs/Clients.
            - futures.after (new function) can now create a Dependent
                with dependencies on RPCs (and their descendents) which
                came from different Hubs/Clients.
            - RPCs and Dependents inherit from Future the methods
                on_finish and on_abort which will line up callbacks to
                run but don't create Dependents.

2.0.0 (4/4/2013
    - new futures implementation, with some backwards-incompatibilities
        - improvements:
            - new Future class is the base for RPC and Dependents, and
                is also useful on its own for building out APIs that can
                cooperatively wait together with RPCs and Dependents.
            - wait_any can now collectively wait on a list of *any*
                futures (including RPCs, Dependents), even if they came
                from different Hubs/Clients.
            - futures.after (new function, see below in backwards
                incompatibilities) can now create a Dependent with
                dependencies on RPCs (and their descendents) which came
                from different Hubs/Clients.
            - RPCs and Dependents inherit from Future the methods
                on_finish and on_abort which will line up callbacks to
                run but don't create Dependents.
        - accompanying backwards incompatibilities:
            - RPC no longer has a "counter" attribute, this is now a private
                implementation detail
            - Hub.wait_any and Client.wait_any are no more, there is now a
                module-level function futures.wait_any that does the same job
            - Hub.dependency_root and Client.dependency_root are no more, now
                you would create a Future and call its finish() method right
                away.
            - new function futures.after(parents, func) works like
                parents[0].after(func, other_parents=parents[1:])
            - RPCs and Dependents no longer have a 'results' attribute, this
                attribute is called 'value' (like their parent class Future)
